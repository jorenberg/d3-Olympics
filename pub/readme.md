### About Olympics
The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<br/><br/>HomePage: https://www.olympic.org/.

### Data collection
Before I even started searching online, I already had an idea in my head about the data that I wanted to play with <i>d3 + Graph Theory + Olympics</i>; all medal winners since the very first Olympic Games in 1896. Thankfully the Guardian had created exactly [this dataset](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/jun/25/olympic-medal-winner-list-data) right before the 2012 Olympics in London, because there wasn't any other place that had the data as nicely structured as the one from the Guardian (The Olympic site itself is quite a hassle where you have to select the edition, sport and event before you see any results).

Then I "only" needed to add the results for 2012 and create a dummy start for all of the events at 2016 that I could then start filling in while the games are being held. Again the Guardian helped out by supplying [a dataset](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/datablog/2012/aug/10/olympics-2012-list-medal-winners) with all of the medallists from 2012.
